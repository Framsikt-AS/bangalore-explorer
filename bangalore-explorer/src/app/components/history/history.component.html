        <p>Bangalore's documented history begins with the founding of a mud fort by Kempe Gowda I, a feudatory ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire in 1537. Kempe Gowda is often referred to as the founder of modern Bangalore.</p>
        <p>Legend has it that Kempe Gowda was hunting in this area when a rabbit turned against his dog. This show of courage impressed him, and he decided this was a good omen and an ideal place to establish his capital.</p>
        <p>The name "Bengaluru" has interesting origins. According to popular belief, the name comes from "Benda Kalu Uru" (Town of Boiled Beans). As the story goes, a hungry king was once served boiled beans by an old woman in this region, and he named the place "Benda Kalu Uru" in gratitude.</p>

        <p>Bangalore's transformation into India's Silicon Valley began in the 1980s when Texas Instruments became the first multinational corporation to establish a presence in the city. The economic liberalization policies of 1991 accelerated the IT boom.</p>
        <p>The city's pleasant climate, presence of skilled workforce due to educational institutions, and proactive government policies made it an attractive destination for global tech companies.</p>
        <p>Today, Bangalore (officially Bengaluru since 2006) is home to numerous IT companies, startups, research institutions, and a vibrant multicultural population that has transformed the once "Garden City" into a bustling metropolis.</p>
